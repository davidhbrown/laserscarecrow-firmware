<h1>URI Laser Scarecrow 2024 Model Firmware</h1>
<p>To use this web page, you must 1) use the Chrome or Edge browser,
    2) allow scripts to load from https://unpkg.com/,
3) install the USB-Serial communications driver for the module (see below)</p>
<h2>Step 1: Confirm correct model</h2>
<p>The 2024 model was supplied fully built, not as a kit as was the case in previous years.
    They have a green, octagonal main circuit board inside the bucket.</p>
<p>If this doesn't match your scarecrow, please <a href="/">return to the home page</a>.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Connect the microcontroller</h2>
<p class="caution">Electronics like the microcontroller and other parts in the scarecrow can be damaged
or destroyed by static electricity. Before working with electronic components...
    ⚡&nbsp;Discharge static electricity built up in your body by touching a cold water pipe or an unpainted center
    screw in a duplex electrical outlet.
    ⚡&nbsp;Avoid synthetic fabrics such as polyfleece.
</p>
<p>The scarecrow should be turned off and disconnected from 12V power (you don't need it).
    Put the cap on the laser module.</p>
<p>Use a good quality USB micro-B data cable (a charging-only cable won't work)
    to connect your computer to the ESP32 microcontroller on the circuit board.
    If making this connection is awkward (e.g., your cable is short), you may remove the microcontroller from
    the main board by holding the sides and pulling it straight up out of the socket.</p>
<p class="info">When connected to USB and still plugged into the main board, the scarecrow may make some sounds from the buzzer, including error tones. This is not a problem when updating the firmware.</p>
<p>Your operating system may need a driver to communicate with the module over USB.
The EPS32 DevkitC modules we use have used the CP2102 USB interface chip from Silicon Labs, though there's a chance your could be different.
If your computer doesn't install it automatically, you can download the CP210x series driver
from <a href="https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads">
        https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads
    </a>.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Update the firmware</h2>
<p>Click the button below and follow its instructions:</p>
<esp-web-install-button
        manifest="ls2024-2.3.0_manifest.json"
></esp-web-install-button>
<h2>Step 4: Disconnect the cable</h2>
<p>After the firmware has been updated, unplug the cable.</p>
<p>If you removed the microcontroller for easier access, replace it. Align each pin on the microcontroller with a hole
    in the sockets. Be sure that  the USB micro connector is on the side of the board that also has the buzzer connector.
Push straight down on the pins on the sides until the microcontroller board is flush with the top of the sockets.</p>
<h2>Step 5: Run a self-test</h2>
<p>The self-test procedure is in the URI Laser Scarecrow Operating Manual.
