<p>Firmware is the program that gives a device its behavior. (Like software for a general-purpose computer but closely
    tied to specific hardware... I guess somewhere between &ldquo;soft&rdquo; and &ldquo;hard&rdquo; is &ldquo;firm?&rdquo;)
    In the URI Laser Scarecrow,
    the behavior is managed by a microcontroller &mdash; a small system-on-a-chip optimized for controlling hardware
    &mdash;
    and the microcontroller module holds the laser scarecrow firmware. </p>
<p>Occasionally we make small changes to the behavior of the URI laser scarecrow after the kits or devices have
    shipped out. You can update your unit to take advantage of these changes here.
    Or if you needed to replace the microcontroller, you could program the new one using this page.</p>
<h2>What you need</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A computer (not a phone/tablet) and the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>
        or Edge browser (not Firefox nor Safari)
    </li>
    <li>A USB micro-B data cable to connect to your computer. One end should look like this:</li>
    <img src="images/USB_Micro-B.svg" style="max-height: 2em;">
    and the other end should connect to your computer. It should also work if you need an adapter between your computer
    and the cable.
    <li>If you have set your browser to block third-party scripts, allow scripts to load from https://unpkg.com/</li>
    <li>One time-only: you'll possibly need to install a driver so your computer can talk to the microcontoller</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step1">Step 1: Connect the microcontroller to your computer</h2>
<p class="caution">Electronics like the microcontroller and other parts in the scarecrow can be damaged
    or destroyed by static electricity. Before working with electronic components...
    ⚡&nbsp;Discharge static electricity built up in your body by touching a cold water supply pipe or an unpainted center
    screw in a duplex electrical outlet.
    ⚡&nbsp;Avoid synthetic fabrics such as polyfleece.
</p>
<p>The scarecrow should be turned off and disconnected from 12V power (you don't need it).
    Put the cap on the laser module.</p>
<p>Open the scarecrow bucket and rotate it so that the key switch is toward you.
    Find the microcontroller on the left side of the main circuit board.
    It is about an inch wide and two inches tall with columns of silvery dots on either edge.</p>
<p>Use a good quality USB micro-B data cable
    to connect your computer to the microcontroller. (A charging-only cable like might have
    come with an older phone won't work.) The USB
    port is toward you and the wider side of the micro-B plug faces up. </p>

</section>
<p class="info"><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> Windows (but not macOS) will make a sound when you connect a device.
    If the microcontroller's red power LED turns on but you don't hear anything, it might be you have a charging-only cable. </p>
<p class="info">When connected to USB and still plugged into the main board, the scarecrow may make some sounds from the
    buzzer, including error tones. This is not a problem when updating the firmware.</p>
<h3>Remove the microcontroller if necessary</h3>
<div class="d-sm-flex flex-sm-row">
    <p>
        If your cable is too short or if you just can't get it to plug in, you may remove the microcontroller from the
        main
        board by tucking your thumb under the circuit board below the USB connector and your finger
        far enough past the thin flat antenna that you can lift the actual circuit board (see photo; all models are
        similar),
        then pull it straight up out of the sockets.</p>
    <p class="ms-sm-2"><img src="images/microcontroller_removal.jpg"
                            alt="close-up photograph of removing the EPS32 microcontroller"></p>
</div>
<h2 id="step2">Step 2: Do you need to install the driver?</h2>
<p>Your computer might install the driver for you automatically when you connect the microcontroller. If an error
    message appears &mdash; especially if it's something
    about not having a driver for the device &mdash; install the driver yourself. If you get a message about the device
    being ready to use, go on to the next step.</p>

<p>If nothing obvious happens, you can just go on to the next step and see if it works.</p>
<h3>Installing the driver</h3>
The EPS32 DevkitC use the <strong>CP2102</strong>
USB interface chip from Silicon Labs. You can download the CP210x
series driver
from <a href="https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads">
    https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads
</a>.</p>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>Download and unzip the &ldquo;CP210x Universal Windows Driver&rdquo;. In that folder, right click
    <code>silabser.inf</code>
    and choose Install. (Windows does not display the .inf unless you open the View menu and tell it to Show Filename
    Extensions.)
</p>
<p><em>Optional:</em> You can confirm whether the microcontroller is recognized by looking for it within &ldquo;Ports (COM &amp; LPT)&rdquo;
    in the Device Manager. It should say &ldquo;Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COM<em>#</em>)&rdquo; (the # is
    some     one- or two-digit number).
</p>
<h4>macOS</h4>
<p>Download and unzip the &ldquo;CP210x VCP Mac OSX Driver&rdquo;. Then double-click
    <code>SiLabsUSBDriverDisk.dmg</code>
    to open (mount) the disk image and install the driver.</p>
<p>With macOS High Sierra 10.13 or later versions, you now have several minutes to go to the Apple menu, select System
    Preferences,
    Security &amp; Privacy, and find at the bottom of the tab where it says that System software from developer Silicon
    Labs
    was blocked. Click the Allow button.</p>
<p><em>Optional:</em> To confirm that the microcontroller is connected, open the System Information, then within Hardware tree select USB.
    Open all the items (busses, hubs) and you should find one (or more) named &ldquo;CP2102 USB to UART
    Bridge&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="info"><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> Try a different cable. Try a different USB port on your computer
    &mdash;
    one directly on the computer can sometimes be more reliable than a hub. Try reloading this page. Try restarting your
    computer.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Install the firmware for your scarecrow</h2>
The installer runs in a pop-up wizard that has limited help, so let's preview what you'll be seeing...
<section id="walkthrough">
    <h3>Installer walkthrough</h3>
    <p class="small">Click the thumbnails to enlarge/reduce. Where to click in the screen captures is circled in
        yellow.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><input id="walkthrough_1" type="checkbox" class="d-none">

                     alt="screen capture showing port selection">
            </label>
            First, your browser will display a list of serial ports. Select the correct port (see the
            Troubleshooting tips above) and click Connect.
        <ul><li>If you don't see any CP210x ports, try reloading the page first and try again,
            then check the driver and cable from the previous step </li>
            <li>If you see multiple ports, unplug the Scarecrow's microcontroller and one should disappear.
                Plug it in again and one should reappear: that's the one to select.</li></ul>
        <li>

                <img src="images/2-device_dashboard.png" alt="screen capture showing device dashboard">
            </label>
            From the &ldquo;Device Dashboard&ldquo;, confirm that you
            have selected the firmware for the correct model year, then click it if correct.
            Click the close button at the upper right (&times;) to cancel.
        </li>
        <li>
            <input id="walkthrough_3" type="checkbox" class="d-none">

                <img src="images/3-erase_device.png" alt="screen capture showing device erase option">
            </label>
            You have an option to erase the device. I have never found this to
            be necessary, but it won't hurt if you feel like enabling that checkbox.
            Click Next to continue or the close button at the upper right (&times;) to cancel.
        </li>
        <li>
            <input id="walkthrough_4" type="checkbox" class="d-none">

                <img src="images/4-confirm.png" alt="screen capture showing confirmation">
            </label>
            Last chance to confirm that you are installing the correct firmware for your scarecrow!
            You can still click the close button at the upper right (&times;) to cancel.
        </li>
        <li>
            <input id="walkthrough_6" type="checkbox" class="d-none">

                <img src="images/6-complete.png" alt="screen capture showing completion">
            </label>
            After usually less than the estimated 2 minutes, you should see that the installation is complete. Click
            next.
        </li>
        <li>
            <input id="walkthrough_7" type="checkbox" class="d-none">

                     alt="screen capture showing dashboard with close button circled">
            </label>
            You will return to the dashboard and can click the close button at the upper right (&times;) to finish.
            If you have any doubts about whether the microcontroller is running the correct firmware,
            you may optionally click &ldquo;LOGS &amp; CONSOLE&rdquo;, then click &ldquo;RESET DEVICE&rdquo; and wait
            to check the last line after everything finishes scrolling. Then click &ldquo;BACK&rdquo; and close the
            updater or try again.

<p class="info"><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong>
    💡Make sure the port you select says something about
    <strong>CP2102</strong> or <strong>CP2102N</strong>
    in its description. On macOS, the name may be more cryptic, something like
    <strong>/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART<em>##</em></strong> where the number ## may vary.
    💡If no devices/ports appear, try reloading this page.
    💡If you get an error about the port being in use, also try reloading this page. (Be sure you picked the correct
    port!)
    💡Too many choices? Figure out which
    is the Scarecrow by unplugging it. Then plug it back in and see what appears in the list.
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Disconnect the cable</h2>
<p>After the firmware has been updated, unplug the cable. (You don't need to &ldquo;eject&rdquo;/unmount it or
    anything.)</p>
<h3>Replace the microcontroller (only if removed)</h3>
<p>If you removed the microcontroller for easier access, replace it. Align each pin on the microcontroller with a hole
    in the sockets. Push straight down on the pins on the sides until the microcontroller board is flush with the top of
    the sockets.</p>
<div class="caution d-sm-flex flex-sm-row">
    <p>It's unlikely but physically possible to insert the microcontroller rotated by 180&deg;. This would surely damage it when turned on.
        To be sure you have the correct rotation, see the images back in <strong><a href="#step1">Step 1</a></strong>
        &mdash; all        models         are similar in their arrangement. A schematic outline of the module is
        silk-screened (white on green or white on blue) on the board. Match the orientation of the module to the
        outline as shown in this side-by-side image.</p>
    <p class="ms-sm-2"><img src="images/module-and-silkscreen.png"
                            alt="Photograph of the ESP32-DevKitC next to its silk-screened outline on main board"></p>
</div>
<h2>Step 5: Run a self-test</h2>
<p>It seems prudent to make sure your scarecrow works after all this!</p>
<p>The self-test procedure is in the URI Laser Scarecrow Operating Manual.
    If you need a copy, please visit <a href="https://laserscarecrow.info/">https://laserscarecrow.info/</a>.</p>

<h2>If you need to buy a new microcontroller</h2>
<p>The microcontroller for the 2022-2024 scarecrow models is the Espressif ESP32-DEVKITC-VIE.
    As of April 2024, these are still in mass production by the manufacturer. We have purchased them from...</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-DEVKITC-VIE/12091811">Digikey</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Espressif-Systems/ESP32-DevKitC-VIE?qs=vmHwEFxEFR%252B9L5ZhUgeToA%3D%3D">Mouser</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can substitute <strong>only</strong> the ESP32-DevKitC-VE. (The only difference is the antenna which we don't
    use anyway.)
    There many other variations with similar names that <strong>will not work</strong>,
    so be careful if you search for a replacement online. Do not buy, for example,
    any of ESP32-DevKitC-32E, ESP32-DevKitC-32UE, or ESP32-DevKitC-DA.
